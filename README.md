This is the starting topology. It represents the network before implementing firewalls and switches.

Stage 1

This shows the implimentation of a firewall, LAN switch, DMZ switch and a Windows Desktop in the network.

Here I implimented commands to configure the firewall to the LAN switch through the gateway 10.128.0.1/24.

I then verified the configuration.

I then configured the DHCP server for the LAN interface using these command prompts.

I verified the configuration here.
